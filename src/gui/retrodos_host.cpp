/*
 * retro-dosbox — plain-C host API over the DOSBox-X core.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 *  - retrodos_host_run() enters DOSBox-X's main(). It returns after the
 *    engine's own teardown, so a host may run several sessions in one
 *    process. (Upstream has historically been treated as a one-shot core;
 *    the asymmetric-teardown bugs that made it so are fixed on this branch.)
 *
 *  - Nothing here calls into the emulator from the caller's thread. Requests
 *    are queued and drained by retrodos_host_pump(), which sdlmain.cpp calls
 *    from GFX_Events().
 *
 *    THE DRAIN POINT MATTERS. The obvious place to drain is the frame
 *    boundary, but DOSBox-X only publishes a frame when the picture CHANGES.
 *    A DOS program effectively always draws something, so that looks fine --
 *    until a guest sits still, at which point the queue stops being drained
 *    entirely: no keys, no mouse, no pause, no quit. And since input is
 *    precisely what would have changed the picture, the machine can never be
 *    woken again. GFX_Events() runs every tick whether or not anything was
 *    drawn, which is why the pump lives there.
 *
 *  - Input uses the same core entry points the Game Link output uses
 *    (MAPPER_CheckEvent with a synthesised SDL_Event, Mouse_CursorMoved,
 *    Mouse_Button*), so DOSBox-X's key mapper -- and therefore every DOS
 *    program -- sees an ordinary key.
 *
 *  - The framebuffer tap reads the Game Link framebuffer, which is a plain
 *    malloc'd 32-bit buffer (0xAARRGGBB little-endian). We are not writing a
 *    renderer, we are re-pointing an existing, upstream-maintained one.

 * each opens tinyfd_openFileDialog() to ask for the filename, and an embedded
 * host has nothing to answer that with. The host supplies the path instead.
 *
 * Both run on the emulator thread, from the pump, because they touch Drives[],
 * imageDiskList[] and the IDE controller.
 *
 * The comment upstream leaves at the top of the IMGMOUNT menu path is worth
 * repeating here: "it would be better to have an internal API for mounting ISO
 * images and replacement. Running a command line to run IMGMOUNT is THE
 * primary reason we cannot provide this menu command while running a guest
 * OS." This is that internal API, for the two cases a host actually needs.

 * check. Without this, inserting a path that does not exist reported success,
 * fired a media change, and left the guest staring at a drive with nothing
 * readable in it -- which looks like a broken emulator, not a bad path.
 *
 * A CD001 descriptor at sector 16 is the ISO 9660 signature. Container
 * formats that are not raw ISO (cue sheets, CHD) are accepted on the strength
