/*
 * Retro-Dosbox (sdl3 branch): SDL2's SDL_syswm.h over SDL3.
 *
 * SDL3 DELETED this header outright. Native window handles now come from the
 * window-properties API:
 *
 *     SDL_PropertiesID p = SDL_GetWindowProperties(win);
 *     Display *d = SDL_GetPointerProperty(p, SDL_PROP_WINDOW_X11_DISPLAY_POINTER, NULL);
 *     Window   w = SDL_GetNumberProperty (p, SDL_PROP_WINDOW_X11_WINDOW_NUMBER, 0);
 *
 * DOSBox-X reads exactly four X11 fields (display, window, fswindow, wmwindow)
 * plus .subsystem, across sdlmain_linux.cpp (X11 IME / WM hints), sdlmain.cpp,
 * clipboard.cpp and glide.cpp -- about 45 sites. Rewriting all of them is
 * pointless churn when the shape maps cleanly, so this reconstructs the old
 * struct and fills it from the new API.
 *
 * fswindow/wmwindow no longer exist as distinct handles in SDL3 (they were
 * SDL2 internals for its own fullscreen/WM wrapper windows); both are reported
 * as the real window, which is what the call sites want -- they use them to
 * set WM properties.
 *
 * This shim is X11-only by design. Under Wayland the subsystem is reported as
 * such and the X11 fields stay zero, so callers take their "unknown windowing
 * system" path rather than acting on a null Display.
