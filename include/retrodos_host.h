/*
 * retro-dosbox — plain-C host API over the DOSBox-X core.
 *
 * This is the only door between the core and any host UI (an SDL3+ImGui
 * frontend, an Android app, a test harness). New capability = new export
 * here, never a platform-specific side channel.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped like retro-x86's retro86_host.h so the two cores in the
 * family present the same surface. Where it DIFFERS, it differs because DOS
 * differs from a PC-in-a-box:
 *
 *   - 86Box inserts media into numbered drive bays. DOS mounts a HOST FOLDER
 *     as a drive letter, which is how nearly every DOS game is actually
 *     launched, so mount_dir() has no 86Box equivalent.
 *   - DOSBox-X's launch channel is a generated .conf file, not a list of
 *     arguments: mounts, machine type, cycles and the [autoexec] that runs the
 *     program all live there. run() therefore takes an argv carrying -conf.
 *   - DOS video modes are frequently non-square-pixel (320x200 is a 4:3
 *     picture, not 16:10), so the host must be told the aspect ratio. 86Box
 *     has no such need.
 *   - send_command() exists because after boot the DOS shell is a real
 *     interface; 86Box has no shell to talk to.
 *
 * THREADING
 * ---------
 * The DOSBox-X mainloop owns essentially all emulator state and is not
 * thread-safe. run() occupies whichever thread calls it. Every other function
 * here is safe to call from another thread: each is either an atomic flag the
 * mainloop reads, or a request the mainloop drains at a safe point. None of
 * them calls into the emulator directly.
