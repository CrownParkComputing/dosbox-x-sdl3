/*
 * retro-dosbox — Storage Access Framework bridge.
 *
 * SAF yields content:// URIs; DOSBox-X mounts a directory BY PATH. So the
 * library is ENUMERATED over SAF (names are all a launcher needs) and the one
 * game being launched is STAGED into the app's own directory, which is a real
 * path. See retrodos_saf.cpp. Stubs on non-Android, so callers need no #ifdef.
